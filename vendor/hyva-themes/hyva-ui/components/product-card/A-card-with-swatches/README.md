## Preview

| Type      |              |

> **Note:** The swatches displayed in the screenshots below make use of `Swatches A`, which can be installed separately.

## Notes

There is no container around this element, assuming your theme already has some kind of container.

The font-family is not altered, unlike the font-sizes and colors. You can change those to fit your design.

The `x-defer` tag is only supported with Hyva theme module version 1.3.7 or higher.

If you're using an older version of the Hyva theme module, this tag will be ignored.
