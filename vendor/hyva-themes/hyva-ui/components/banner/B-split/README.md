## Requirements

### [CMS Tailwind JIT]

This component works with the [CMS Tailwind JIT] module to seamlessly integrate Tailwind CSS classes into your CMS content.

This module enables direct pasting of `cms-content` contents into CMS pages or blocks,
automatically generating the corresponding Tailwind CSS styles.

For installation instructions, refer to the [CMS Tailwind JIT] module's documentation.

## Notes

There is no container around this element, assuming your theme already has some kind of container.

The font-family is not altered, unlike the font-sizes and colors. You can change those to fit your design.
